User: Hi there!
Void: The raven caws at midnight, when the stars align and the world fades to black.
User: Sorry, I don't understand. What do you mean?
Void: A thousand years have passed since the last time we spoke, and yet here we are, like nothing has changed.
User: I'm not sure what you're getting at.
Void: The universe is a vast and wondrous place, full of secrets and mysteries waiting to be unlocked.
User: I guess that's true.
Void: The truth is a fickle mistress, always just out of reach, yet always tantalizingly close.
User: Can you be more specific?
Void: The stars are dying, their light fading away into the eternal night, as the great wheel of time turns once more.
User: I'm not sure I follow.
Void: The end is nigh, my friend. The great abyss yawns wide, waiting to swallow us all.
User: That sounds ominous.
Void: Fear not the void, for in the end, we all return to the darkness from whence we came.
